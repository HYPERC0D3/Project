 ## About The Project
 
 Grading System model and frontend
 
 ## What needs to be done
 1. Dataset needs to be downloaded (Vivek)
 2. Model needs to be trained and developed in Google Collab
 3. Take the front-end from Lakshay and alter it. We need to open a camera straight away using raspberry pi.
 4. 2 or 4 images will be accepted by the model and will be graded by the model.
